1) To clone the repo
   command:  git clone <repo url>  [<localname>]
   
   eg.  git clone https://github.com/repo1.git      	(clones the code into a folder named 'repo1')
        git clone https://github.com/repo1.git  suresh  (clones the code into a folder named 'suresh')
		git clone https://github.com/repo1.git   .      (clones the code into current location)


2) To know which branch you are currently in.
   command:  git branch
   
   it shows the branches names and indicates the current branch with *
   
   eg. $ git branch
           main
		 * branch1
		   branch2
		 
3) To create a new branch 
   command:  git checkout -b <branch name>   <base branch> 
   eg.  $ git checkout -b branch1 remotes/origin/main       (creating a new branch on the default branch 'main')
															(remotes/origin indicates server)
		
	Switched to new branch 'branch1'
	branch1   remotes/origin/main	
	$ git branch
		main
	  *	branch1 
								
4) To push the local branch to the server
   command: git push origin <branchname>

   eg.  $ git push origin branch1

5) To switch/change to a branch 
   command: git checkout <branchname>
  eg. 
     git branch
     git checkout branch2

6) To commit the changes like creation,modification,deletion of any files 
   
   make sure that the new files are being added before commit
   command:  git add <filename>
   eg.  git add newfile.txt

   Do commit now.
   
   command: git commit -a -m "message description" 
  eg. $ git commit -a -m "files added" 

7) To push the current changes to server, use git push command.
  
	 
	 
	 
main
  release_1.0.0.0
		feature_1ofrel1
		    suresh_branch
			ramesh_branch
			arun_branch
		feature_2ofrel1
			hema_branch
			netra_branch
			
			
after the completion of feature1, branch feature1ofrel1 is merged into release_1.0.0.0 branch and hence feature_1ofrel1 will not be present.

main
	release_1.0.0.0
		feature2_ofrel1   (netra_branch is merged and completed)
			hema_branch 	
		


once feature2 also completed, then

main
	release_1.0.0.0
	
	release_1.1.0.0
